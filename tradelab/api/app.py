"""The operator interface. Plan.md §20.

Two rules shape every route here, and both are refusals.

**It computes nothing.** Every figure returned was computed by a worker and
persisted. A number that exists only on screen is a number nobody can reproduce,
so this application reads the registry and reports what is in it — it does not
calculate a Sharpe, a drawdown or a utilisation. Time series belong to Grafana;
this surface exists because a decision needs an actor and a timestamp.

**It cannot start live trading.** There is no route that switches a strategy's
mode, and there is no venue credential in this process. The interface *requests*
a transition; the gate evaluates it and the executor acts. Mode is displayed,
never edited, and displayed prominently, because mistaking simulator for live is
the error this design is most concerned with.
